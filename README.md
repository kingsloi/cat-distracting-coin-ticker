# Crypto Tracking Pet Feeding Office Pi
Raspberry Pi Zero W with a 2.13" ePaper display, which monitors your cryptocoin portfolio, displays weather and time, and also dispenses treats (via stepper motor) to my animals every hour on the hour between 12am - 5am.

Written in node and python, because I don't know Python, and every ePaper nodejs library that I tried, didn't work.
